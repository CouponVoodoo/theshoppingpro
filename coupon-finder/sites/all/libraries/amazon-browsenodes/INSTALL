                     SETUP: How to install the library ?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to use the Amazon Library you have to put it on your (development) server, and 
include it in your script. You can put it somewhere in the INCLUDE_PATH, or 
specify the full path to the "amazon_api_class.php" file.

You have to modify the "aws_signed_request.php" file too. You will need to enter your 
Amazon Associate ID

 $params["AssociateTag"]     = 'YOUR-ASSOCIATES-ID-HERE';

You will also need to make sure that cURL is installed on your system.
